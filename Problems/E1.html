<h1>Random Pair</h1>

Chefu is Chef's little brother, he is 12 years old and he is new to competitive programming.Chefu is practicing very hard to become a very skilled competitive programmer and win gold medal in IOI.<br><br>

Now Chefu is participating in a contest and the problem that he is trying to solve states:<br><br>

Given an array A of N integers, find any i, j such that i &lt; j and Ai + Aj is maximum possible.Unfortunately, there's no much time left before the end of the contest, so Chefu doesn't have time to think of correct solution, so instead, he wrote a solution that selects a random pair (i, j) (i < j) and output Ai + Aj. each pair is equiprobable to be selected.<br>
Now Chefu wants your help to calculate the probability that his solution will pass a particular input.<br><br>



<h3>Input</h3><br>
First line contains an integer T denoting the number of test-cases.<br>
First line of each test-case contains a single integer N<br>
Second line of each test-case contains N space-separated integers A1 A2 ... AN<br><br>
<h3>Output</h3><br>
For each test-case output a single line containing a single number denoting the probability that Chefu's solution to output a correct answer. your answer will be accepted if the absolute difference between it and correct answer is less than 1e-6<br><br>

<h3>Constraints</h3><br>
1 &le; T &le; 100<br>
2 &le; N &le; 100<br>
1 &le; Ai &le; 1,000<br>
 

<h3>Example</h3>
<h3>Input:</h3>
3<br>
4<br>
3 3 3 3<br>
6<br>
1 1 1 2 2 2<br>
4<br>
1 2 2 3<br><br>

<h3>Output:</h3><br>
1.00000000<br>
0.20000000<br>
0.33333333<br><br><br><br>
