	<h1> Wealth Disparity</h1>
	
	
Boing Inc, has N employees, numbered 1 ... N. Every employee other
than Mr. Hojo (the head of the company) has a manager (P[i] denotes
the manager of employee i). Thus an employee may manage any number
of other employees but he reports only to one manager, so that the
organization forms a tree with Mr. Hojo at the root. We say that
employee B is a subordinate of employee A if B appears in the
subtree rooted at A.<br>

Mr. Hojo, has hired Nikhil to analyze data about the employees to
suggest how to identify faults in Boing Inc. Nikhil, who is just a
clueless consultant, has decided to examine wealth disparity in the
company. He has with him the net wealth of every employee (denoted
A[i] for employee i). Note that this can be negative if the
employee is in debt. He has already decided that he will present
evidence that wealth falls rapidly as one goes down the
organizational tree. He plans to identify a pair of employees i and
j, j a subordinate of i, such that the wealth difference between i
and j is maximum. Your task is to help him do this.<br><br>

Suppose, Boing Inc has 4 employees and the parent (P[i]) and wealth
information (A[i]) for each employee are as follows:<br><br>
i 1 2 3 4<br>
A[i] &nbsp;5 10 6 12<br>
P[i] &nbsp;2 -1 4 2<br><br>
P[2] &nbsp;= -1 indicates that employee 2 has no manager, so employee 2 is
Mr. Hojo.<br><br>
In this case, the possible choices to consider are (2,1) with a
difference in wealth of of 5, (2,3) with 4, (2,4) with -2 and (4,3)
with 6. So the answer is 6.<br><br>

<h3>Input Format:</h3>
There will be one line which contains (2*N + 1) space-separate
integers. The first integer is N, giving the number of employees in
the company. The next N integers A[1], .., A[N] give the wealth of
the N employees. The last N integers are P[1], P[2], .., P[N],
where P[i] identifies the manager of employee i. If Mr. Hojo is
employee i then, P[i] = -1, indicating that he has no manager.<br><br>

<h3>Output Format:</h3>
One integer, which is the needed answer.
Constraints:
-10^8 &le; 
A[i] &le; 10^8, for all i.<br>
Subtasks:<br>
For 30% of the marks, 1 &le; N &le; 500.<br>
For 100% of the marks, 2 &le; N &le; 10^5.<br><br>

	<h3>Sample Input:<br></h3>
	4 5 10 6 12 2 -1 4 2<br>
	
	<h3>Sample Output:<br></h3>
