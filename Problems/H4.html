<h1>Bamboo Art</h1>
Lavanya is installing a piece of bamboo art for the Siruseri Biennale. Her installation will consist
of a sequence of bamboo shoots of increasing lengths, abstractly representing the ascent of culture
in the world. She also wants to arrange the bamboo shoots so that the difference in length between
adjacent bamboo shoots remains the same, to maintain symmetry.<br>
She has with her a set of bamboo shoots. She will only use the bamboo shoots as they are,
because cutting bamboo goes against her principles. Your task is to determine the maximum
number of bamboo shoots she can use from this set as part of her installation.<br>
Suppose she had a collection of 7 bamboo shoots of lengths 15, 8, 10, 20, 17, 13, 5. From these, she
could pick bamboo shoots of lengths 13, 15 and 17 to form an installation of size 3. Alternatively,
she could pick bamboo shoots of lengths 5, 10, 15 and 20 to form an installation of size 4. You can
check that she cannot form an installation of size 5 or higher using this collection.<br>
In this task, you will be given a number N, describing the number of bamboo shoots in Lavanyaâ€™s
collection and the lengths of the N bamboo shoots. You may assume that no two bamboo shoots
in the collection have the same length.<br>
Your task is to output the size of the largest installation that Lavanya can create out of these
bamboo shoots.<br>
<h3>Input format</h3>
There is only one line, which contains N + 1 space separated integers.<br>
The first integer is N, giving the number of bamboo shoots.<br>
That is followed by N distinct, non-negative integers, giving the lengths of the N bamboo
shoots.<br>
<h3>Output format</h3>
One line containing a single integer giving the size of the largest installation that Lavanya can
create.<br>
<h3>Test data</h3>
You may assume that the lengths of the bamboo shoots lie in the range 0 to 105
, both inclusive.<br>
You may also assume that all bamboo shoots have distinct lengths.
Subtask 1 (40 Marks)<br>
You may assume that 1 &le; N &le; 400, where N is the number of bamboo shoots.
Subtask 2 (60 Marks)<br>
You may assume that 1 &le; N &le; 2500, where N is the number of bamboo shoots.<br>
<h3>Sample input</h3>
7 15 8 10 20 17 13 5<br>
5<br>
<h3>Sample output/<h3>
4
<h3>Explanation</h3>
N = 7, and the bamboo shoots have lengths {15, 8, 10, 20, 17, 13, 5}. This is the same example
explained above. So the answer is 4.
