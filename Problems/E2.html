<h1>K Fibonnaci</h1>
<br>

<p>Chef recently had been studying about Fibonacci numbers and wrote a code to print out the kth term of the Fibonacci series(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on.). He was wondering whether he could write a program to generate the kth term for similar series.<br> More specifically : T(n, k) is 1 if n <= k and T(n, k) = T(n-1, k) + T(n-2, k) + T(n-3, k) and so on + T(n-k, k) if n > k . Given n and k output T(n, k)%(1000000007) as the answer could be very large </p>

<h3>Input</h3>
Two integers ,N and K 
<h3>Output</h3>
Output description.<br>
One integer, the nth term of the series mod 1000000007 

<h3>Constraints</h3>
1  	&lt; N, K &lt; 2*105

<h3>Example</h3>
Input:<br>
7 5<br>
<br>
Output:<br>
9<br>


<h3>Explanation</h3>
Example case 1. The series is as follows {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 9}<br>
