<h1>Training</h1>
Ash and his Pokemon Pikachu are going on a journey. Ash has planned his route for the journey so that it passes through N cities, numbered 1, 2, ..., N, and in this order.
<br>
When they set out, Pikachu has an initial strength of S<sub>in</sub> as well as an experience value (XV) of 0. As theytravel they may increase his strength and experience value in a manner to be described below. In each city, Ash can choose either to train Pikachu or let Pikachu battle the Gym-leader (but not both). The Gym-leader in i<sup>th</sup> city has experience E[i]. If Pikachu enters a city i with strength S and decides to train, then this increases his strength by the cube of the sum of the digits in his current strength. For example, if he entered a city with a strength of 12, then training will increase his strength to 12 + (1+2)3 = 39. On the other hand, if he enters city i with strength S and battles the Gym-leader, then this increases his experience value XV by S*E[i]. Ash wants your help to find out the maximum XV that Pikachu can attain at the end of his journey.
<br><br>
Input
<br>
The first line contains two space separated integers, N and S<sub>in</sub>, which are the number of cities, and the initial strength, respectively.The second line contains N space separated integers, which correspond to E[1], E[2],..., E[N].
<br><br>
Output
<br>
A single integer which is the maximum XV that Pikachu can attain.
<br>
<br>
Constraints
<br>
For all test cases you may assume that:
<br>
1 &le; N &le; 5000<br>
0 &le; S<sub>in</sub> &le; 109<br>
0 &le; E[i] &le; 104
<br>
Subtask 1
: For 10% of the score, N &le; 20 and S<sub>in</sub> = 1<br>
Subtask 2
: For further 40% of the score,E[i] = k for all i i.e. E[i] is some constant 
k
, for all 
i
<br>
Subtask 3
: For further 50% of the score,
<br>
No further constraints.

Example
<br>
Input 1:
<br>
2 12
<br>
5 10
<br>
<br>
Output 1:
<br>
390
<br>
Explanation 1
<br>
Suppose Pikachu trains in the first city
, his strength will increase to 39, because as explained above, 12 +
(1+2)
3
 = 39. If he battles in the first city
, his XV will increase by (12*5) = 60.
If Pikachu trains in the first city
, and then battles in the second city
, his XV will increase by 39*10 = 390. So,
the final XV will be 0+390 = 390. Y
ou can check that you cannot do better than this. Hence the answer is
390.
<br>
<br>
Input 2:
<br>
4 1
<br>
100 1 6 2
<br>
Output 2:
<br>
120
<br>
Explanation 2
<br>
Pikachu battles in the first city
, trains in the second and third, and then battles in the fourth city
. So his
strength going into each of the four cities is (1, 1, 2, 10). And so he gains 1*100 XV from the first city and
10*2 XV from the fourth city
. This gets him a total of 120 XV
, and you can verify that nothing better can be
done.
